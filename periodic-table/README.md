# Periodic Table Project

This project is a simple implementation of the periodic table using HTML and CSS. It visually represents all the chemical elements, grouped and color-coded according to their properties, in a clean and organized layout.

## Features

- **Interactive Layout**: Each element is placed in its correct position on the periodic table.
- **Color Coding**: Elements are color-coded based on their category (e.g., metals, non-metals, noble gases, etc.).
- **Responsive Design**: The table adjusts its layout based on the screen size for better accessibility on different devices.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structuring the elements and table.
- **CSS3**: For styling and color-coding the elements.
